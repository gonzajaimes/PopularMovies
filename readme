protected ArrayList<Movie> doInBackground(String... params) {
            // These two need to be declared outside the try/catch
            // so that they can be closed in the finally block.
            HttpURLConnection urlConnection = null;
            BufferedReader reader = null;
            String sortBy = params[0];

            //insert "your key"
            String key = "your key";
